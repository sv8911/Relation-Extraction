# Project Name

A Multi-Model Approach to Relation Extraction: BERT Embeddings with XGBoost and Graph Neural Networks

## About the Project
This project focuses on Relation Extraction, comparing two major approaches: a traditional machine learning model and a graph-based neural network. We implement XGBoost as our traditional model and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) as our graph-based approach, utilizing the re-DOCRED dataset. For both models, the input data is pre-processed and converted into BERT embeddings to capture rich contextual features. The goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of these distinct methodologies in extracting relationships from text data.

## Built With
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or more installed
- pip (Python package manager)
- conda (optional)

### Installation

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install the required dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Please note that for importing torch-cluster library, Visual C++ libraries should be already installed (Visual Studio Build Tools: You’ll need a C++ compiler, and Microsoft’s Visual Studio Build Tools is the standard choice)**

**Minimum components: MSVC C++ build tools,Windows SDK**
